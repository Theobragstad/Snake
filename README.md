#### <img src="/data/right.jpg" width="20px"/> Snake game

New and improved version of the classic snake game 
<br>

Features:
- Control a snake to eat as many fruits as possible and grow longer without running into yourself
- Set snake color and speed
- Allow snake to move through edges or not
- Set number of fruits
- Set fruits to move or stay still
- Save score
- View top scores on the leaderboard
<br><br>

I used Processing for this game because it is similar to Java and allows for simple yet effective animation  
<br>

How to run: 
- Download Processing 3+
- Clone or download this repository into a new folder named 'snake'
 - Processing should do this automatically for you if needed, but you may need to move all files including the '.pde' one into this new folder so that the resources are loaded correctly
- Make sure 'names.txt', 'scores.txt', and 'snake.pde' are in the same directory as the "data" folder
- Open and run 'snake.pde' 
<br>

Future improvement ideas    
- [ ] Ensure that fruits are never placed on top of the snake  
- [ ] Add more game modes  
- [ ] Fix checkbox bug/UI improvements
