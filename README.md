#### Snake

New and improved version of the classic snake game 
<br>

Features:
- Control a snake to eat as many fruits as possible and grow longer without running into yourself
- Set your snake's color and speed
- Allow your snake to move through edges (or not)
- Set the number of fruits
- Set the fruits to move or stay still
- Save your score
- View the top scores on the leaderboard
<br><br>

I used Processing for this game because it is similar to Java and allows for simple yet effective animation  
<br>

How to run:  
- Download Processing 3+
- Clone or download this repository into a new folder named 'snake' (the name is important)
- Open and run 'snake.pde'
<br>

Future improvement ideas    
- [ ] Add more game modes and variable point calculations
