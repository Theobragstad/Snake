# Snake

New version of the classic snake game 
___
## Primary features:
- Control a snake to eat as many fruits as possible and grow longer without running into yourself
- Set snake color, speed
- Allow snake to move through edges
- Set number of fruits
- Set fruits to move
- Save score
- View top scores on leaderboard
- And more!
___
I used Processing for this game to take advantage of its:
 - inherently visual/art-based nature
 - similarity to Java, and
 - the ease with which it allows for simple yet effective animation.   
___
**How to run**: 
- Ensure you've downloaded Processing 3+
- Clone or download this repository into a new folder named 'snake'.
 - Processing should do this automatically for you if needed, but you will then need to move all files including the '.pde' one into this new folder so that resources are loaded correctly.
- Make sure 'names.txt', 'scores.txt', and 'snake.pde' are in the same directory as the "data" folder.
- Open and run 'snake.pde' in Processing 3 (4 works too).  
___  
Ideas for future improvement:  
- Ensure that fruits are never spawned on top of the snake  
- Add more game modes  
- Fix minor checkbox issue
