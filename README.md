#### Snake game

New version of the classic snake game 
<br>

Features:
- Control a snake to eat as many fruits as possible and grow longer without running into your snake
- Set snake color, speed
- Allow snake to move through edges
- Set number of fruits
- Set fruits to move
- Save score
- View top scores on leaderboard
- And more!
<br><br>

I used Processing for this game because it is similar to Java and allows for simple yet effective animation  
<br>

How to run: 
- Download Processing 3+
- Clone or download this repository into a new folder named 'snake'
 - Processing should do this automatically for you if needed, but you will then need to move all files including the '.pde' one into this new folder so that resources are loaded correctly
- Make sure 'names.txt', 'scores.txt', and 'snake.pde' are in the same directory as the "data" folder
- Open and run 'snake.pde' 
<br>

Future improvement ideas    
- [ ] Ensure that fruits are never spawned on top of the snake  
- [ ] Add more game modes  
- [ ] Fix minor checkbox issue
